description: "Get Shannon running in under 10 minutes with Docker Compose"
---

## Prerequisites

Before installing Shannon, ensure you have:

- **Docker** (20.10+) and **Docker Compose** (v2.0+)
- **Git** for cloning the repository
- **LLM API Key** (OpenAI, Anthropic, or other supported provider)
- At least **4GB RAM** available for Docker

<Note>
Shannon works on Linux, macOS, and Windows (with WSL2). All examples assume a Unix-like environment.
</Note>

## One-Command Setup

Shannon provides a streamlined setup process that gets you running in minutes:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Kocoro-lab/Shannon.git
cd Shannon

# Initialize configuration and generate protocol buffers
make setup

# Add your LLM API key
echo "OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-key-here" >> .env

# Download Python WASI interpreter (required for sandboxed execution)
./scripts/setup_python_wasi.sh

# Start all services
make dev
```

That's it! Shannon is now running with all required services.

## What Gets Installed

The `make dev` command starts the following services via Docker Compose:

| Service | Port | Description |
|---------|------|-------------|
| **Gateway** | 8080 | REST API gateway |
| **Orchestrator** | 50052 | gRPC orchestration service |
| **Agent Core** | 50051 | Rust-based agent execution |
| **LLM Service** | 8000 | Python LLM provider gateway |
| **Dashboard** | 2111 | Real-time monitoring UI |
| **PostgreSQL** | 5432 | Persistent storage |
| **Redis** | 6379 | Caching and pub/sub |
| **Qdrant** | 6333 | Vector database |
| **Temporal** | 7233 | Workflow engine |
| **Temporal UI** | 8088 | Workflow visualization |

## Verify Installation

Check that all services are running:

```bash
# View service status
docker compose ps

# All services should show "healthy" or "running"
```

Test the API:

```bash
# Submit a simple task
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/v1/tasks \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "query": "What is 2+2?"
  }'

# You should receive a response with a task_id
```

## Access the Dashboard

Open your browser and navigate to:

- **Shannon Dashboard**: http://localhost:2111
- **Temporal UI**: http://localhost:8088

The dashboard provides real-time task monitoring, event streaming, and system metrics.

## Configuration

Shannon is pre-configured for local development, but you can customize it:

### Environment Variables

The `.env` file (created by `make setup`) contains key configuration:

```bash
# LLM Provider Keys
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-key-here
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-your-key-here

# Service Configuration
GATEWAY_SKIP_AUTH=1  # Disable auth for development
LOG_LEVEL=info

# Database
POSTGRES_USER=shannon
POSTGRES_PASSWORD=shannon_dev
POSTGRES_DB=shannon

# Redis
REDIS_URL=redis://redis:6379
```

<Warning>
In production, set `GATEWAY_SKIP_AUTH=0` to enable API key authentication.
</Warning>

### Configuration Files

Advanced configuration is available in the `config/` directory:

- `shannon.yaml` - Main system configuration
- `features.yaml` - Feature flags
- `models.yaml` - LLM provider pricing and routing

## Common Issues

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Port conflicts">
    If you see port binding errors, check that ports 8080, 50051, 50052, 8000, etc. are not in use:

    ```bash
    # macOS/Linux
    lsof -i :8080

    # Stop conflicting services or change ports in docker-compose.yml
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Docker memory issues">
    Shannon requires at least 4GB RAM. Increase Docker's memory limit:

    - **Docker Desktop**: Settings → Resources → Memory (set to 6GB+)
    - **Linux**: Docker uses all available memory by default
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Python WASI download fails">
    If `setup_python_wasi.sh` fails, manually download:

    ```bash
    mkdir -p wasm-interpreters
    cd wasm-interpreters
    wget https://github.com/vmware-labs/webassembly-language-runtimes/releases/download/python%2F3.11.4%2B20230714-11be424/python-3.11.4.wasm
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Services won't start">
    Check Docker logs for errors:

    ```bash
    docker compose logs orchestrator
    docker compose logs agent-core
    docker compose logs llm-service
    ```

    Common causes:
    - Missing `.env` file (run `make setup`)
    - Invalid API keys
    - Insufficient Docker resources
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Development Setup

Run core dependencies via Docker, then run services locally to iterate:

```bash
# Terminal 1: Start dependencies only (DB, cache, vector, Temporal)
docker compose -f deploy/compose/docker-compose.yml up -d postgres redis qdrant temporal

# Terminal 2: Run Orchestrator locally (gRPC 50052, admin 8081)
cd go/orchestrator
go run ./cmd/server

# Terminal 3: Run Agent Core locally (gRPC 50051)
cd ../../rust/agent-core
cargo run

# Terminal 4: Run LLM Service locally (HTTP 8000)
cd ../../python/llm-service
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py

# (Optional) Terminal 5: Run Gateway locally (REST 8080)
cd ../../go/orchestrator/cmd/gateway
go run .
```
