## Your First Task

Let's submit a simple task to Shannon and see it in action. This guide assumes you've completed the [installation](/quickstart/installation).

## Using the REST API

The simplest way to interact with Shannon is through its REST API:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/v1/tasks \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "query": "Analyze the sentiment of: Shannon makes AI agents simple and reliable!"
  }'
```

You'll receive a response like:

```json
{
  "task_id": "task-dev-1730000000",
  "status": "TASK_STATUS_RUNNING",
  "message": "Task submitted",
  "created_at": "2024-10-22T10:30:00Z"
}
```

## Check Task Status

Use the `task_id` to check the status:

```bash
curl http://localhost:8080/api/v1/tasks/task-dev-1730000000
```

Response:

```json
{
  "task_id": "task-dev-1730000000",
  "status": "TASK_STATUS_COMPLETED",
  "response": { "result": "The sentiment is overwhelmingly positive..." },
  "error": "",
  "query": "Analyze the sentiment of: Shannon makes AI agents simple and reliable!",
  "session_id": "...",
  "mode": "EXECUTION_MODE_STANDARD",
  "created_at": "2024-10-22T10:30:00Z",
  "updated_at": "2024-10-22T10:30:25Z"
}
```

## Stream Events in Real-Time

Shannon supports Server-Sent Events (SSE) for real-time updates:

```bash
curl -N http://localhost:8080/api/v1/tasks/task-dev-1730000000/stream
```

You'll see events as they happen:

```
event: AGENT_THINKING
data: {"message":"Analyzing sentiment..."}

event: TASK_COMPLETED
data: {"result":"The sentiment is positive..."}
```

## Using the Python SDK

For a better developer experience, use the Python SDK:

### Installation

```bash
pip install shannon-sdk
```

### Submit and Monitor Tasks

```python
from shannon import ShannonClient

# gRPC for submission; SSE uses admin 8081 by default
client = ShannonClient()

handle = client.submit_task(
    query="Analyze the sentiment of: Shannon makes AI agents simple!"
)
print("Task submitted:", handle.task_id)

# Wait for completion
final = client.wait(handle.task_id, timeout=60)
print("Result:", final.result)
```

### Stream Events

```python
# Stream events in real-time
for event in client.stream(handle.workflow_id):
    print(f"{event.type}: {event.message}")
```

## Execution Modes

Shannon auto-selects execution modes internally based on task complexity. The REST API does not accept a `mode` parameter at this time.

## Cost Control

Budget controls are managed by Shannon. Explicit per‑request budget settings are not yet available via REST.

## Multi-Turn Conversations

Shannon supports session-based conversations:

```python
session_id = "my-conversation-123"

# First message
handle1 = client.submit_task(
    query="What is the capital of France?",
    session_id=session_id
)

# Follow-up message (Shannon remembers context)
handle2 = client.submit_task(
    query="What's the population?",
    session_id=session_id
)

# Shannon knows you're asking about Paris's population
```

## Using the Dashboard

Open http://localhost:2111 to access the interactive dashboard:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Submit Tasks">
    Use the task submission form to create tasks with custom configurations
  </Step>
  <Step title="Monitor Execution">
    Watch real-time event streams showing agent thinking, tool invocations, and progress
  </Step>
  <Step title="View Metrics">
    Track token usage, costs, latency, and success rates across all tasks
  </Step>
  <Step title="Debug Workflows">
    Click on tasks to view detailed execution traces and Temporal workflow history
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Example Use Cases

<Note>
Shannon automatically selects the appropriate execution mode and cognitive strategy based on query complexity. You don't need to specify these parameters.
</Note>

### Sentiment Analysis

```python
client.submit_task(
    query="Analyze sentiment: The product exceeded my expectations!"
)
```

### Research & Summarization

```python
client.submit_task(
    query="Research quantum computing breakthroughs in 2024 and create a summary"
)
```

### Code Generation

```python
client.submit_task(
    query="Write a Python function to calculate Fibonacci numbers with memoization"
)
```

### Complex Analysis with Context

```python
client.submit_task(
    query="Compare the pros and cons of microservices vs monolithic architecture",
    context={
        "domain": "software_architecture",
        "depth": "comprehensive",
        "include_examples": True
    }
)
```

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Task stays in 'running' state">
    Check the logs for errors:

    ```bash
    docker compose logs orchestrator
    docker compose logs agent-core
    ```

    Common causes:
    - Invalid LLM API key
    - LLM provider rate limiting
    - Network connectivity issues
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Authentication errors">
    Shannon runs with authentication disabled by default (`GATEWAY_SKIP_AUTH=1`). If you've enabled auth, include an API key:

    ```bash
    curl -H "X-API-Key: sk_test_123456" \
      http://localhost:8080/api/v1/tasks
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="High costs / token usage">
    Budget limits are configured at the platform level via environment variables:

    ```bash
    # In .env file
    MAX_TOKENS_PER_REQUEST=10000
    MAX_COST_PER_REQUEST=0.50

    # Restart services for changes to take effect
    docker compose restart
    ```

    For per-task monitoring, check costs via the status endpoint or streaming events.
  </Accordion>
