<Warning>
Task cancellation is **only available via the Python SDK and gRPC**. The REST API does not currently support a `DELETE /api/v1/tasks/{id}` endpoint. Use the SDK methods below.
</Warning>

## Overview

Cancel a running task to stop execution and free resources. Cancellation is graceful and may take a few seconds to complete.

## SDK Method Signature

### Python SDK (Sync)

```python
def cancel(
    self,
    task_id: str,
    reason: Optional[str] = None,
    timeout: Optional[float] = None
) -> bool
```

### Python SDK (Async)

```python
async def cancel(
    self,
    task_id: str,
    reason: Optional[str] = None,
    timeout: Optional[float] = None
) -> bool
```

### Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|-------------|
| `task_id` | string | Yes | Task identifier to cancel |
| `reason` | string | No | Optional cancellation reason |
| `timeout` | float | No | Request timeout in seconds |

### Returns

- **Type**: `bool`
- **Value**: `True` if cancellation was successful, `False` otherwise

## Examples

### Basic Cancellation

```python
from shannon import ShannonClient

client = ShannonClient()

# Submit a task
handle = client.submit_task(query="Long running analysis...")

# Cancel the task
success = client.cancel(handle.task_id)
print("Task cancelled" if success else "Cancellation failed")
```

### Cancellation with Reason

```python
from shannon import ShannonClient

client = ShannonClient()

# Cancel with reason
success = client.cancel(
    task_id="task-dev-1730000000",
    reason="User requested abort"
)

if success:
    print("Task cancelled successfully")
else:
    print("Failed to cancel task")
```

### Async Cancellation

```python
from shannon import AsyncShannonClient
import asyncio

async def cancel_task():
    async with AsyncShannonClient() as client:
        # Submit task
        handle = await client.submit_task(query="Process large dataset...")

        # Cancel after some condition
        success = await client.cancel(
            task_id=handle.task_id,
            reason="Timeout exceeded"
        )

        return success

# Run async
result = asyncio.run(cancel_task())
print(f"Cancellation {'succeeded' if result else 'failed'}")
```

## Behavior and Considerations

### Graceful Cancellation

Cancellation is not instantaneous. When you call `cancel()`:

1. The cancellation request is sent to the Temporal workflow
2. The workflow receives the cancellation signal
3. Running agents complete their current operation
4. Resources are cleaned up and the task status updates to `TASK_STATUS_CANCELLED`

This process typically takes 1-5 seconds.

### Partial Results

Tasks cancelled mid-execution may have partial results available. Check the task status after cancellation:

```python
# Cancel task
client.cancel(task_id)

# Wait a moment for cancellation to complete
import time
time.sleep(2)

# Check final status
status = client.get_status(task_id)
if status.result:
    print("Partial result:", status.result)
```

### Cost Implications

- **Tokens consumed before cancellation are still charged**
- Check `status.metrics.cost_usd` to see accumulated costs
- Budget limits are enforced even on cancelled tasks

### When Cancellation Fails

The `cancel()` method returns `False` if:
- Task ID not found
- Task already completed/failed/cancelled
- Network/connection error

Handle failures appropriately:

```python
from shannon import errors

try:
    success = client.cancel(task_id, reason="User abort")
    if not success:
        print("Task may have already completed")
except errors.TaskNotFoundError:
    print("Task does not exist")
except errors.ConnectionError as e:
    print(f"Connection failed: {e}")
```
