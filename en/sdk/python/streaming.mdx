## Overview

Shannon provides real-time event streaming to monitor task execution as it happens.

## Basic Usage

```python
from shannon import ShannonClient

client = ShannonClient()  # Streams via gateway base_url (default http://localhost:8080)

handle = client.submit_task(query="Analyze market trends")

for event in client.stream(handle.workflow_id):
    print(f"[{event.type}] {event.message}")
    if event.type == "WORKFLOW_COMPLETED":
        break
```

## Event Types

Common events you'll see:
- `WORKFLOW_STARTED` - Execution started
- `LLM_PROMPT` / `LLM_PARTIAL` / `LLM_OUTPUT` - Model activity
- `TOOL_INVOKED` / `TOOL_OBSERVATION` - Tool usage
- `APPROVAL_REQUESTED` / `APPROVAL_DECISION` - Human-in-the-loop
- `ERROR_OCCURRED` - Error surfaced
- `WORKFLOW_COMPLETED` - Execution finished

<Note>
This is a subset of available events. See the `EventType` enum in the SDK for the full list (e.g., `STATUS_UPDATE`, `ROLE_ASSIGNED`, `TEAM_RECRUITED`, `DELEGATION`).
</Note>

## Async Streaming

```python
import asyncio
from shannon import AsyncShannonClient

async def stream_task():
    async with AsyncShannonClient() as client:
        handle = await client.submit_task(query="Analyze data")

        async for event in client.stream(handle.workflow_id):
            print(f"Event: {event.type}")
            if event.type == "WORKFLOW_COMPLETED":
                break

asyncio.run(stream_task())
```

## Filtering and Resume

Filter by event types and resume from a known point:

```python
from shannon import EventType

types = [EventType.LLM_OUTPUT, EventType.WORKFLOW_COMPLETED]

last_event_id = None
for event in client.stream(handle.workflow_id, types=types, last_event_id=last_event_id):
    print(event.type)
    last_event_id = event.id  # for resume later
    if event.type == EventType.WORKFLOW_COMPLETED:
        break
```
