## Key Features

### Multi-Agent Orchestration
Shannon coordinates multiple AI agents using proven cognitive patterns like Chain-of-Thought (CoT), Tree-of-Thoughts (ToT), and ReAct, enabling complex task decomposition and parallel execution.

### Production-Ready
Built with production workloads in mind:
- **Temporal workflows** for durable, deterministic execution
- **WASI sandboxing** for secure Python code execution
- **Circuit breakers** and failure protection
- **Comprehensive observability** with Prometheus metrics and OpenTelemetry tracing

### Multi-Provider Support
Seamlessly switch between LLM providers:
- OpenAI (GPT-4, GPT-3.5)
- Anthropic (Claude 3 Opus/Sonnet/Haiku)
- Google Gemini
- Groq, Azure OpenAI, Ollama, and more

## Use Cases

Shannon excels at:

- **Complex Task Automation**: Break down complex tasks into manageable subtasks with automatic orchestration
- **Research & Analysis**: Coordinate multiple agents for comprehensive research and synthesis
- **Code Generation**: Secure Python code execution in WASI sandbox
- **Multi-Step Workflows**: Durable workflows that survive failures and can be replayed for debugging
