## Introduction

Manage user sessions used to group related tasks and context.

Notes:
- Soft delete only. `DELETE` marks a session as deleted (keeps data) and returns 204.
- Deleted sessions are excluded from reads and cannot be fetched (404).

## List Sessions

```
GET /api/v1/sessions?limit=20&offset=0
```

Query params:
- `limit` (1â€“100, default 20)
- `offset` (>= 0, default 0)

Response (200):
```json
{
  "sessions": [
    {
      "session_id": "a0c2b1e2-...",
      "user_id": "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000002",
      "task_count": 3,
      "tokens_used": 1234,
      "token_budget": 10000,
      "created_at": "2025-10-28T06:00:00Z"
    }
  ],
  "total_count": 1
}
```

## Get Session

```
GET /api/v1/sessions/{sessionId}
```

Path params:
- `sessionId` (uuid)

Response (200): session metadata including token usage and task count.
Errors: 401, 403, 404.

## Get Session History

```
GET /api/v1/sessions/{sessionId}/history
```

Returns all tasks in the session with execution details.
Errors: 401, 403, 404.

## Get Session Events

```
GET /api/v1/sessions/{sessionId}/events?limit=200&offset=0
```

Returns SSE-like events across all tasks in the session.
Notes:
- Excludes `LLM_PARTIAL` for cleaner chat history.
- Returns 404 if the session is deleted.

## Delete Session (Soft Delete)

```
DELETE /api/v1/sessions/{sessionId}
```

Behavior:
- Marks the session as deleted (`deleted_at`, `deleted_by`), does not remove data.
- Idempotent: always returns 204 for the owner.
- Clears session cache to prevent stale reads.

Responses:
- 204 No Content
- 400 Invalid `sessionId` (must be uuid)
- 401 Unauthorized
- 403 Forbidden (not the owner)
- 404 Not Found
